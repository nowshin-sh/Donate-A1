        <h1>Let’s Help Those Who Are<br> More In Need</h1>
        <p>
            Since May 2022, Bangladesh has been hit with one of the worst floods in years,<br> with millions in Sylhet
            and
            Sunamganj now homeless and without any belongings. We would like to stand beside the flood-affected people.

                    We aim to address the urgent needs of the affected population by providing essential relief

                    the basic well-being of those impacted. We prioritize efficient distribution by collaborating
                    closely with local organizations and government agencies, ensuring that aid reaches those who need
                    it most promptly.
