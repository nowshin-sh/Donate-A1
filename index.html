        <p>
            Since May 2022, Bangladesh has been hit with one of the worst floods in years,<br> with millions in Sylhet
            and
            Sunamganj now homeless and without any belongings. We would like to stand beside the flood-affected people.

                    We aim to address the urgent needs of the affected population by providing essential relief
